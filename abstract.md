## Email: part 1 and 2

Thank you for registering to the "First Steps with Go" training.
Let me remind you that this training aims to teach how to write Go programs to an audience of beginers.

Please come with your laptop with Go installed, Git would be nice but is not mandatory, and an appetite to learn Go!
Check out the official page for installing Go and testing your installation: https://golang.org/doc/install#install.

Looking forward to meeting you at Golab.
